Car Specifications Scraper ðŸš—


Project Description
This project is a web scraper built to extract car model specifications, variants, prices, and other details from automotive websites like CarWale. The scraper collects data such as engine specifications, dimensions, safety features, fuel efficiency, and pricing, then organizes it into a structured CSV file for analysis or comparison.

The project leverages Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas to fetch, parse, and store the data.
